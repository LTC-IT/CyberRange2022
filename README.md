# CyberRange2022

 This is the main repository for The Cyber Range project for 2022 at LTC.

 This will be used with the Year 12 Robotics class to syncronise their projects into a central location.

 Dumb people will fork the repository and create pull requests to include their changes.

If you're using light mode Github you will be shamed.
